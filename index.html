<p>I'm currently a epidemiologist research fellow based in Atlanta, GA. I'm passionate about cross-discipline collaboration and bringing new analytical techniques into different spaces. I'm adept at collecting, managing, analyzing, and converting data -- into data visualizations and data analyses that can have an impact, or into optimizing program efficacy through data-driven decisions. While I've most often focused on spatial statistics, spatial epidemiology, operations research, and a touch of software development, I've worked in a wide variety of disciplines, mainly within the public health space.</p>

<p>I use this GitHub account as a way for me to work upon various data science projects outside of my normal work duties. Additionally, I contribute issues to a few projects - e.g., <a href="http://github.com/fxi/AccessMod_shiny/" target="_blank">AccessMod v.5.0</a> - as a way to give back to the development community, and to provide end-user feedback on software modifications. </p>
