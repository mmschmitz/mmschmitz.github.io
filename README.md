## Michelle M. Schmitz, MSPH

I'm currently a research fellow based at the (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention)[https://www.cdc.gov/], based in Atlanta, GA. I use this GitHub account as a way for me to work upon various data science projects outside of my normal work duties. Additionally, I contribute issues to a few projects - e.g., (AccessMod v.5.0)[http://github.com/fxi/AccessMod_shiny/] - as a way to give back to the development community, and to provide end-user feedback on software modifications.

_The work presented on this site is mine, and does not necessarily represent the official position of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention._
